    <p>
    Facials help to renew skin cells by circulating the blood flow under the skin, which then can decrease
    puffiness and fluid build up that comes from our lymphatic system. Good circulation is important in that it
     brings oxygen, proteins and nutrition to the skin, while ridding our skin of toxins.
